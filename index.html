        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

        <p>I am currently living in Szeged, Hungary and I work as a full stack web developer since 2002.</p>

        <p>I speak Hungarian and Serbian natively, and English on a relatively high, technical level.</p>

        <p>I am open to new tech and I constantly try to learn and be informed, but I don't get easily distracted. I tend to focus on easily adaptable, well-documented, entrenched, lightweight and clear-cut foundations when I build applications, and keep complexity to a minimum where possible. I am a strong proponent of the KISS, the YAGNI, and the DRY principles.</p>

        <p>The main values I try to live by in all aspects of my life are rationality, openness, sincere communication, modesty, purity, patience, resourcefulness and humble dignity towards traditions and established practices.</p>

        <h3>SKILLS</h3>

        <div class="skill-container">
            <p>
                ⋆ <strong>Backend</strong><br />
                During my career I have met with Python, Perl, ASP, ActionScript, Rails and Go for shorter or longer periods, but I work most quickly and efficiently with PHP (continuous practice starting from purely procedural PHP 4 up to object oriented PHP 8).
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking into account PHP frameworks, I have the most experience with CodeIgniter and Laravel, but I have also used Symfony, Yii, CakePHP and Phalcon.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-container">
            <p>
                ⋆ <strong>Frontend</strong><br />
                I have worked with frontend since the beginning of my career, and I have a sensible knowledge of XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Regarding JS, I have the most experience in writing jQuery and vanilla JS (ES6), but I also had involvement in React projects.<br />
                At the moment I am learning TypeScript.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-container">
            <p>
                ⋆ <strong>Databases</strong><br />
                I am mainly familiar with relational databases (mostly MySQL/MariaDB, but SQLite and PostgreSQL too), but in the past I have used non-relational databases (mainly MongoDB) too.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-container">
            <p>

                - Experience with Content Management Systems: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, TYPO3.<br />
                - Experience with Linux (both GUI and CLI). I have a self-built Ubuntu based LAMP server for hosting my hobby-projects<br />
                - I use Docker as a dev environment.<br />
                - I use PHPStorm for writing code (equipped with sniffers, mess detectors, linters and debuggers).<br />
                - I use Git for version control.<br />
                - Experience with unit- and functional testing with PHPUnit, and also have experience with Behat.<br />
